Takes positional arguments for the color count constraints and reads
the games record from stdin. The sum of the ids of the "possible"
games is output to stdout.

For example `<program> 1 2 3` will calculate the sum of the ids of
the possible games if there was 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and
3 blue cubes.
